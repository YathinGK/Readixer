# ✍️ Handwritten Notes Converter – Readixer Module

A component of **Readixer**, this project focuses on converting handwritten notes into digital text using OCR (Optical Character Recognition) and deep learning models. It provides an intuitive interface for uploading handwritten files and receiving clean, editable text output.

## 🚀 Features

- 🖼️ Upload handwritten images or PDF files
- 🧠 Utilizes a trained OCR model for handwriting recognition
- 📝 Extracts readable and editable digital text
- 📦 API integration support for external use
- 🌐 Clean and interactive UI built with Streamlit

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Frontend/UI**: Streamlit
- **Backend**: Python
- **OCR Model**: Trained using TensorFlow/Keras (you can mention the specific model if known)
- **Libraries**: 
  - `opencv-python`
  - `pytesseract`
  - `streamlit`
  - `PIL`
  - `numpy`

## 🖼️ How It Works

1. Upload an image or scanned file of handwritten notes.
2. The backend processes the image using preprocessing (grayscale, thresholding, etc.).
3. The model predicts the characters and words.
4. The result is displayed as editable text for further usage.
